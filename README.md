# Collective


## Problem
##### My proposed app is a social media app for users who collect vinyl. An intuitive and aesthetically pleasing place for users to catalog their collection easily, make friends based on suggestions that use which records are in a user’s top 5, and possibly see their collections worth, view records for sale on their wishlist and list records for sale on Discogs. Collective will also provide an easy way to check if a record you’re thinking of purchasing is already in your collection.

## Why Build it?
##### I’ve collected records since I was gifted my vinyl at 14 years old. It was “The Dream of Blue Sea Turtles”. While it definitely isn’t in my top 5 records anymore, I still own it and I still have a very clear memory of playing that record for the first time. I think I should build a capstone that I’m passionate about and one of my greatest passions has always been vinyl. I also have a problem with buying the same record multiple times, I’d like to figure out an easy way to make sure I don’t duplicate in a collection I already have - unless of course, the condition is better.
